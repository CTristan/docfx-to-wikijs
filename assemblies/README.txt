Place the game's managed assemblies (DLLs) in this directory.

Typically, you will need:
- Assembly-CSharp.dll
- UnityEngine.dll
- UnityEngine.CoreModule.dll
- Any other dependent UnityEngine modules.

These can usually be found in your game installation folder under:
{GameName}_Data\Managed\

Example (Lobotomy Corporation):
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\LobotomyCorp\LobotomyCorp_Data\Managed\
