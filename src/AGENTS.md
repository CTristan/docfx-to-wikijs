# Gemini Project Context: Source Code Conventions

## Python Code Structure
- **Single Responsibility**: All Python files in the `src` folder must have only one public method.
- **Naming Convention**: Python files must be named exactly the same as their single public method (e.g., a file containing only `def process_data()` should be named `process_data.py`).
