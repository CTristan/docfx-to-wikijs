# Gemini Project Context: DocFX Documentation

## Project Overview
This project is a documentation site generator for the Unity game *Lobotomy Corporation* (inferred from code symbols like `BinahBoss`, `CreatureGenerate`). It utilizes **DocFX** to generate API references directly from the game's assemblies (DLLs) and combines them with Markdown documentation to produce a static website.

## Directory Structure
- **`assemblies/`**: Contains the managed assemblies (DLLs) of the game, including `Assembly-CSharp.dll` (main game logic) and Unity engine libraries. These are the source of truth for the API documentation.
- **`api/`**: Contains YAML metadata files generated by DocFX from the assemblies in `assemblies/`. These files represent the structure of the classes, methods, and properties.
- **`_site/`**: The output directory containing the generated static HTML website.
- **`docfx.json`**: The main configuration file for DocFX, defining input sources (`src/`), output destinations (`api/`, `_site`), and templates.
- **`main.py`**: A Python script entry point (currently a placeholder).
- **`pyproject.toml`**: Python project configuration using `uv` for dependency management, including tools like `mypy` and `ruff`.

## Building and Running

### Prerequisites
- **DocFX**: Required to generate metadata and build the site.
- **Python 3.12+**: Required for the Python tooling.
- **uv**: Recommended for managing Python dependencies.

### Key Commands

#### Documentation Build
To build the documentation site from the source DLLs and Markdown files:
```bash
# Generate metadata and build the site
docfx docfx.json
# Or serve locally
docfx docfx.json --serve
```

#### Python Environment
To set up and run the Python environment:
```bash
# Install dependencies
uv sync

# Run the main script
uv run python main.py

# Linting and Type Checking
uv run ruff check .
uv run mypy .
```

## Conventions
- **API Generation**: The project relies on `assemblies/Assembly-CSharp.dll` as the primary source for API documentation. Avoid manually editing generated files in `api/` unless you are sure they won't be overwritten, or use `overwrite` files if configured.
- **Markdown**: General documentation is written in standard Markdown (e.g., `index.md`).
- **Python Style**: Adhere to `ruff` and `mypy` standards for any Python scripts added to the project.
